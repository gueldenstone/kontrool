* Try the fade function
* try the vibration motor (4x pcs) with the extra power needed (figure out the transistor circuit for it)
* Redesign display + specific display clearing functionality 
* BPM average 
* Current BPM vs Goal BPM with the vibration motor
* Figure out a way to do the Arm sleeve/casting (3D model in STL for 3D printing)
* Op-amp circuit for CV/Modular(Muscle sensor) + Gate for the Pulse sensor 
* MIDI (???)
